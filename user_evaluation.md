# User Evaluation of Harpocrates

## Introduction

Harpocrates is a Web Application for redacting sensitive documents with Machine Learning (ML) classification of documents by sensitivity and an explanation for this classification (i.e. why is this sensitive or not?).

The goal of this application is to aid reviewers by allowing them to prioritize document review and speed it up. Today, we're trying to assess how effective this application and specifically some key features are in doing that.

You will be given some time to browse and understand the application, then you will use it to review a set of documents, some of which are sensitive others not. They have been analyzed by the application which has estimated their sensitivity, note: _this estimation might not be accurate_ and this tool is an aid for the reviewer, not a replacement, so you may rightfully disagree with its estimations. You will also review some documents without the applications' help.

While you are reviewing documents, a timer will estimate the interface's ability to help you review documents faster. We will also record your interactions with the application (clicks and mouse movements) to understand how it has helped or hindered you while reviewing documents. Lastly, we'll provide a short questionnaire on your impressions using the application.

Feel free to take breaks or stop completely if you wish and ask any questions you want. If you are willing, lets review documents.
