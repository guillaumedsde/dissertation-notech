@inproceedings{bartramContinuousZoomConstrained1995,
  abstract = {Navigating and viewing large information spaces, such as hierarchically-organized networks from complex realtime systems, suffer the problems of viewing a large space on a small screen. Distorted-view approaches, such as fisheye techniques, have great potential to reduce these problems by representing detail within its larger context but introduce new issues of focus, transition between views and user disorientation from excessive distortion. We present a fisheyebased method which supports multiple focus points, enhances continuity through smooth transitions between views, and maintains location constraints to reduce the user's sense of spatial disorientation. These are important requirements for the representation and navigation of networked systems in supervisory control applications. The method consists of two steps: a global allocation of space to rectangular sections of the display, based on scale factors, followed by degree-of-interest adjustments. Previous versions of the algorithm relied solely on relative scale factors to assign size; we present a new version which allocates space more efficiently using a dynamically calculated degree of interest. In addition to the automatic system sizing, manual user control over the amount of space assigned each area is supported. The amount of detail shown in various parts of the network is controlled by pruning the hierarchy and presenting those sections in summary form.},

Fishnet accomplishes this by using a fisheye view, i.e. by showing a focus region at readable scale while spatially compressing page content above and below that region. Fishnet offers search term highlighting, and assures that those terms are readable by using "popouts". This allows users to visually scan search results within the entire page without scrolling.The scope of this paper is twofold. First, we present fishnet as a novel way of viewing the results of highlighted search and we discuss the design space. Second, we present a user study that helps practitioners determine which visualization technique--- fisheye view, overview, or regular linear view---to pick for which type of visual search scenario.},

We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create a visualization that also reflects semantic content.

Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom, selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text.},

Addressing these limitations, we present a modular visual analytics framework, tackling the understandability and adaptability of topic models through a user-driven reinforcement learning process which does not require a deep understanding of the underlying topic modeling algorithms. Given a document corpus, our approach initializes two algorithm configurations based on a parameter space analysis that enhances document separability. We abstract the model complexity in an interactive visual workspace for exploring the automatic matching results of two models, investigating topic summaries, analyzing parameter distributions, and reviewing documents. The main contribution of our work is an iterative decision-making technique in which users provide a document-based relevance feedback that allows the framework to converge to a user-endorsed topic distribution. We also report feedback from a two-stage study which shows that our technique results in topic model quality improvements on two independent measures.},

A fisheye view presents the area of current interest in normal scale but as distance from the interest area increases, information scale decreases. In Kaugar's document viewer, there could be multiple areas of interest, each defined by the presence of a search term in a sentence. These areas would be displayed in a normal font. Other sentences and paragraphs were shown in a smaller font. This allowed the user to very easily find and read relevant passages while ignoring intervening and mostly irrelevant text. Users could define new areas of interest in the document with a mouse click thereby returning those areas to a normal sized font. Because the documents were much smaller in size than the normal full sized scrolled view, much more of the relevant text fit within a single window on the computer screen perhaps making it easier to make relevance judgements.

We review two relevant lines of research bearing on this question and show how our results are being used in the design of a new Web interface for cross-language text retrieval. One line of research, "interactive IR", is concerned with the user interface issues for information retrieval systems such as how best to display the results of a text search. We review our current research, on "document thumbnail" visualizations, and discuss current Web conventions, practices and folklore. The other area of research, "Cross-Language Text Retrieval", is concerned with the design of automatic techniques, including Machine Translation, to retrieve texts in languages other than the language of the query. We review work we have done concerning query translation and multilingual text summarization. We then describe how these results are being applied and extended in the design a new demonstration interface, Keizai, an end-to-end, Web-based, cross-language text retrieval system. Beginning with an English query, the system will search Japanese and Korean Web data and display English summaries of the top ranking documents. A user should be able to accurately judge which foreign language documents are relevant to their information need and glean necessary information from the translation to schedule specific documents for human translation and subsequent analysis.},

@article{schneiderToolsMethodsProcessing2017a,
  abstract = {We present several approaches and methods which we develop or use to create workflows from data to evidence. They start with looking for specific items in large corpora, exploring overuse of particular items, and using off-the-shelf visualization such as GoogleViz. Second, we present the advanced visualization tools and pipelines which the Visualization Group at University of Konstanz is developing. After an overview, we apply statistical visualizations, Lexical Episode Plots and Interactive Hierarchical Modeling to the vast historical linguistics data offered by the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), which ranges from 1800 to 2000. We investigate on the one hand the increase of noun compounds and visually illustrate correlations in the data over time. On the other hand we compute and visualize trends and topics in society from 1800 to 2000. We apply an incremental topic modeling algorithm to the extracted compound nouns to detect thematic changes throughout the investigated time period of 200 years. In this paper, we utilize various tailored analysis and visualization approaches to gain insight into the data from different perspectives.},

@article{stoffelDocumentThumbnailsVariable2012,
  abstract = {Document reader applications usually offer an overview of the layout for each page as thumbnail views. Reading the text in these becomes impossible when the font size becomes very small. We improve the readability of these thumbnails using a distortion method, which retains a readable font size of interesting text while shrinking less interesting text further. In contrast to existing approaches, our method preserves the global layout of a page and is able to show context around important terms. We evaluate our technique and show application examples.},
