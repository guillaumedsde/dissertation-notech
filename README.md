# Notech Repository

This repository holds files related to my level 4 dissertation that are not source code. This repository's issue tracking will also be used for Notech issues (that don't directly relate to a codebase).

All markdown in this repository is rendered in PDF using [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) and [Gitlab CI](https://gitlab.com/visualising-sensitivity-classification-features/notech/pipelines). The PDFs are published on Gitlab Pages with the following url structure:

```
https://visualising-sensitivity-classification-features.gitlab.io/notech/<name of original file including extension>.pdf
```

So the link to the rendred PDF for `timelog.md` would be [https://visualising-sensitivity-classification-features.gitlab.io/notech/timelog.md.pdf](https://visualising-sensitivity-classification-features.gitlab.io/notech/timelog.md.pdf)


Development (issues, boards, CI, Docker respositories...) happens on [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/visualising-sensitivity-classification-features/notech) and a mirror (source code only, no issues etc...) of this repository is available on [github.com](https://github.com/guillaumedsde/dissertation-notech).
